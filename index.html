      <h3>Profile</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Senior SOC / DFIR Analyst (Tier II) with end-to-end ownership of the incident
          lifecycle, from alert intake and correlation to containment, eradication and
          post-incident review. Strong hands-on experience operating in global, remote-first
          environments using enterprise SIEM, EDR and SOAR platforms to detect, validate and
          respond to advanced threats.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daily work includes triaging and correlating events from Microsoft Sentinel,
          Splunk and other SIEMs; performing host- and network-based analysis through
          Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud, CrowdStrike and native
          telemetry; and orchestrating actions through Cortex XSOAR and ticketing systems
          such as ServiceNow. Investigations are mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK to understand
          adversary behavior and identify coverage gaps.
        </p>

        <p>
          Experienced in building and refining playbooks, escalation paths and
          classification criteria so that SOC operations are repeatable and measurable.
          Comfortable working with KQL, SPL and other query languages to perform advanced
          hunting, IOC sweeps and hypothesis-driven threat hunting across hybrid
          infrastructures (cloud + on-prem + remote endpoints).
